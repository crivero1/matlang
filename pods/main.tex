\begin{abstract}
Linear algebra algorithms often require some sort of iteration or recursion as is illustrated by standard algorithms for Gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, and transitive closure. A key characteristic shared by these 
algorithms is that they allow looping for a number of steps that is bounded by the matrix dimension. 
In this paper we extend the matrix query language \lang with this type of recursion, and show that this suffices to express  classical linear algebra algorithms. We study the expressive power of this language and show that it naturally corresponds to arithmetic circuit families, which are often said to capture linear algebra. Furthermore, we analyze several sub-fragments of our language, and show that their expressive power is closely tied to logical formalisms on semiring-annotated relations.
% how they can capture the expressive power of annotated relations and weighted logics.
