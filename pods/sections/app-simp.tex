To simplify some proofs, we assume \langfor to have functions that process only matrices of size $1\times 1$.
As stated in section \ref{sec:restrict}, if we have this restricted form of \textit{function application},
using the \texttt{for} operator, we can do \textit{function application} on matrices of arbitrary (but equal) size.
Furthermore, we can accomplish this using only $\ssum$.

The constant in expressions are assumed to be $1\times 1$ matrices. 
For instance, when we write $(1-e_{\ones}(v)^T\cdot v)$ we actually mean $([1]-e_{\ones}(v)^T\cdot v)$.
