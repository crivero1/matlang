We proposed \langfor, an extension of \lang with limited recursion,
and showed that it is able to capture most of linear algebra due to its
connection to arithmetic circuits. We further revealed interesting connections
to logics on annotated relations. Our focus was on language design and
expressivity. An interesting direction for future work relates to efficient
evaluation of (fragments) of \langfor. A possible starting point is \cite{Christ_2013}
in which a general methodology for communication-optimal algorithms
for for-loop linear algebra programs is proposed.
%Additionally, our results of Section \ref{ss:sumML} show interesting opportunities for exploring how relational joins can be evaluated using matrix operations, and vice versa.
