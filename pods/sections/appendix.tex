\subsection{Arithmetic circuits (AC)}
An arithmetic circuit $\Phi$ over a set $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ of variables is a directed
acyclic labelled graph. The vertices of $\Phi$ are called gates and denoted by $g_1,\ldots,g_m$;
the edges in $\Phi$ are called wires. The children of a gate $g$ correspond to all gates
$g'$ such that $(g,g')$ is an edge. The parents of $g$ correspond to all gates $g'$ 
such that $(g,g')$ is an edge. The in-degree of a gate $g$ refers to its number of children,
the out-degree to its number of parents. Gates with in-degree $0$ are called input gates
and are labelled by either a variable in $X$ or a constant $0$ or $1$. Every other gate
is labeled by either $+$ or $\times$ and are referred to sum or product gates, respectively.
Gates with out-degree $0$ are called output gates.

\floris{Restrictions on fan-in?}

The size of $\Phi$, denoted by $|\Phi|$, is its number of gates. The depth of a gate $g$, denoted
by $\mathsf{depth}(g)$, is the length of the longest directed path reaching $g$. The depth of $\Phi$
is the maximal depth of a gate in $\Phi$. An arithmetic circuit $\Phi$ corresponds to a polynomial in $\mathbb{N}[X]$ in a natural way. The degree of $\Phi$ is the degree of the polynomial corresponding to $\Phi$.

An arithmetic circuit family is a set of arithmetic circuits $\{\Phi_n\mid n=1,2,\ldots\}$ where $\Phi_n$ has $n$ input variables. An arithmetic circuit family is uniform if there exists a logspace-computable function
which on input $1^n$ returns an encoding of an arithmetic circuits $C_n$ for each $n=1,2$. We observe that
uniform arithmetic circuit families are necessarily of polynomial size.

\subsection{From MATLANG to uniform ACs}
We connect MATLANG with arithmetic circuits as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item We first show that for every MATLANG expression $e$ we can associate a uniform arithmetic circuit family $\{\Phi_n^e\mid n=1,2,\ldots\}$ such that when $I$ is matrix instance of dimension $n$ (or $n\times n$), we can obtain $e(I)$ by evaluating $\Phi_n$ on $I$. \floris{The connection between the dimensions of instances etc and the ``$n$'' in the arithmetic circuits needs to be made precise. E.g., if we have $n^2$ matrices, we need more than $n$ variables...}
\end{itemize}
As a consequence, blah blah....

In general, uniform arithmetic circuit family $\{\Phi_n^e\mid n=1,2,\ldots\}$ is not necessarily of polynomial degree. Indeed, consider it suffices to consider the MATLANG expression which computes
$f_n(x)=x^{2^n}$. 
As uniform arithmetic circuit families of polynomial degree have nice properties, e.g., they can be assumed to be of logarithmic depth, we next want to zoom in such families. In what follows we therefore limit ourselves to MATLANG expressions $e$ such that $\{\Phi_n^e\mid n=1,2,\ldots\}$ is a family of polynomial degree arithmetic circuits.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Checking whether a MATLANG expression $e$ corresponds to a family of of polynomial degree arithmetic circuits is undecidable. 
\end{itemize}

Let $e$ be a ``nice'' MATLANG expression, i.e.,  $\{\Phi_n^e\mid n=1,2,\ldots\}$ is a family of polynomial degree arithmetic circuits which can be assumed to be logarithmic depth.

% 	\item There exists a MATLANG expression that can
