%With the raise of Machine Learning applications we have witnessed in recent years, there is an increasing need for languages that allow us to reason about matrix operations. 

%Matrix operations are at the very core of most Machine Learning algorithms deployed these days. Due to this, there is an increasing need to define languages allowing us to reason about matrix manipulation and more generally, about linear algebra. Several such proposals have been put forward by the database community, mostly focusing on how matrices are manipulated statically. On the other hand, many linear algebra operations require some sort of iteration or recursion. Examples of these are computing the Gaussian elimination, the inverse of a matrix, or its transitive closure.
%
%By observing that the recursion required in these algorithms amounts to repeating 


The introduction.

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain why this is important.
\item Say what sort of things we would like to express.
\item Give a quick tour of our minimal language (examples).
\item Stress our concrete contributions.
\item Relate to previous work \cite{matlang,BrijderGBW19,Geerts19,HutchisonHS17}.
\end{itemize}
