%With the raise of Machine Learning applications we have witnessed in recent years, there is an increasing need for languages that allow us to reason about matrix operations. 

%Matrix operations are at the very core of most Machine Learning algorithms deployed these days. Due to this, there is an increasing need to define languages allowing us to reason about matrix manipulation and more generally, about linear algebra. Several such proposals have been put forward by the database community, mostly focusing on how matrices are manipulated statically. On the other hand, many linear algebra operations require some sort of iteration or recursion. Examples of these are computing the Gaussian elimination, the inverse of a matrix, or its transitive closure.

%By observing that the recursion required in these algorithms amounts to repeating

Linear algebra algorithms have become one of the key components in data analytical workflows. As such, there is growing interest in the database community to integrate linear algebra functionality in relational database management systems \cite{}. More specifically, from a query language perspective several proposals have recently been proposed that attempt to unify relational algebra and linear algebra. For example, LARA~\cite{} is a minimalistic language in which a number of atomic operations on so-called associative tables are proposed. Since such tables generalise relational tables, matrices and tensors, the aimed unification of linear and relational algebra is obtained. A key operator in LARA is the extension operator, which is parametrized by (user-defined) functions. Hence, the capabilities of LARA are inherently linked to the allowed functions. Fragments of LARA are known to be expressive complete to first-order logic with aggregation~\cite{}. Furthermore, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, LARA can not compute the inverse of a matrix.\cite{}. This is primarily due to the absence of a recursion mechanism in LARA. In another line of work~\cite{}, matrices are encoded as relational tabels and and extensions of SQL are proposed to carry out matrix manipulations. In particular, \cite{} extends SQL with a limited form of recursion -- alike dynamic programming - such that linear algebra-based algorithms such as .. and xx can be simulated. To our knowledge, the expressive power of this recursive extension of SQL is not know. Yet another proposal, on which we will built on, is \lang, a pure matrix query language. It consists of a number of atomic linear algebra operators (transpose, matrix multiplication, ...) but it is limited in expressive power. Indeed, it is known to be subsumed in first-order logic with aggregates (just as LARA) but it is already include in the three-variable fragment thereof. This again implies that matrix inversion or any other recursive linear algebra algorithm is beyond the capabilities of \lang.

What we aim for in this paper is to extend \lang with a natural notion of recursion. By inspecting any textbook on linear algebra algorithms a natural candidate pops up: for loops.
