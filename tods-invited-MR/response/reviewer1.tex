(\ldots) I would however suggest to expand a bit the paragraph on \textbf{Related work} at the
bottom of page three, and to give more details; in particular this concerns the remark
that classical logics with aggregation and fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) can also
be used for linear algebra. This point deserves a bit more attention and more references
to the literature (for instance to the work of Anuj Dawar and his co-authors). It is
known that FPC can express a large collection of linear-algebraic algorithms over fields
of characteristic 0 whereas there are severe obstacles in fields with finite characteristics.
Incidentally, it is a pity that the authors exclusively consider linear-algebraic problems
over the field of reals. I would welcome if the authors could, at least briefly, discuss the
power of for-MATLANG for other fields.
