\section{Extended MATLANG expressiveness}

Since there are expressions that depend on order Z (or S), we define an \textit{order invariant expression}.

$E(Z)$ is order invariant if $$\forall Z_1, Z_2. \sem{E(Z_1)}=\sem{E(Z_2)}.$$
Note that the definition depends on $Z$, but it is well defined because we can compute $Z$ from $S$ and viceversa.

Additionally, we define an \textit{instance order invariant expression}.

Let $\cM_1$ and $\cM_2$ be instances such that for all $A\in var(\cM_1)=var(\cM_2)$ we have that

\begin{align*}
	\cM_1(A)&=\cM_2(A) \\
	can(\cM_1)[i]&\neq can(\cM_2)[i]
\end{align*}
for some $i=1, \ldots, n$, with $n=dim(\cM_1)=dim(\cM_2).$ $E$ is instance order invariant if $\sem{E}(\cM_1)=\sem{E}(\cM_2)$

Some questions arise.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does exists a formula in $\sum$MATLANG + order that is order invariant?
	\item If there exists some expression $E$ in $\sum$MATLANG that is order invariant, does there exists $E'\in\sum$MATLANG such that $$\forall\cM.\sem{E}(\cM)=\sem{E'}(\cM)$$
	\item Does there exists $E\in\sprod$MATLANG that is instance order invariant? Is there $E\in\sprod$MATLANG such that $\sem{E}(\cM_1)\neq\sem{E}(\cM_2)$?
	
\end{itemize}
